              Miniaturized solid zinc‐ion batteries that are safe, environmentally friendly, and low‐cost are ideal candidates for powering emerging microelectronics. However, sluggish Zn

              2+
              electrolytes and hence their practicability. Here, nanoscale Zn
              2+
              channels are successfully engineered in a plastic‐crystal electrolyte, thus activating fast Zn
              2+
              solid‐state transport. The ion‐dipole interaction exerted by water molecules orients amphiphilic anions in bilayers, further forming a layered architecture backed by long‐range van der Waals attractive forces. In the interlayer, the heteroleptic coordination contributed by the water molecule and anion frees the Zn

              from anionic traps, leading to a high Zn

	abstract = {Designing solid electrolyte is deemed as an effective approach to suppress the side reaction of zinc anode and active material dissolution of cathodes in liquid electrolytes for zinc metal batteries (ZMBs). Herein, kaolin is comprehensively investigated as raw material to prepare solid electrolyte (KL Zn) for ZMBs. As demonstrated, KL Zn electrolyte is an excellent electronic insulator and zinc ionic conductor, which presents wide voltage window of 2.73 V, high ionic conductivity of 5.08 mS cm 1, and high Zn2+ transference number of 0.79. For the Zn//Zn cells, superior cyclic stability lasting for 2200 h can be achieved at 0.2 mA cm 2. For the Zn//NH4V4O10 batteries, stable capacity of 245.8 mAh g 1 can be maintained at 0.2 A g 1 after 200 cycles along with high retention ratio of 81 \%, manifesting KL Zn electrolyte contributes to stabilize the crystal structure of NH4V4O10 cathode. These satisfying performances can be attributed to the enlarged interlayer spacing, zinc (de)solvation-free mechanism and fast diffusion kinetics of KL Zn electrolyte, availably guaranteeing uniform zinc deposition for zinc anode and reversible zinc (de)intercalation for NH4V4O10 cathode. Additionally, this work also verifies the application possibility of KL Zn electrolyte for Zn// MnO2 batteries and Zn//I2 batteries, suggesting the universality of mineral-based solid electrolyte.},

	abstract = {Precise control over the catenation process in interlocked supramolecular systems remains a significant challenge. Here, we report a system in which a lantern-shaped Pd2L4 cage can dimerize to form two distinct Pd4L8 catenanes with different interlocking degree: a previously described quadruply interlocked double cage motif of D4 symmetry and an unprecedented triply interlocked structure of C2h symmetry. While the former structure features a linear arrangement of four Pd(II) centers, separated by three mechanically linked pockets, the new motif has a staggered shape. Both assemblies are topological isomers, coexisting in equilibrium in solution. The triply interlocked species is thermodynamically more stable due to extended noncovalent interactions between the ligands, as supported by X-ray structure analysis and electronic structure calculations. Notably, the degree of interlocking in the double cage system can be controlled by a change of temperature and through anion exchange. Cage-to-cage transformations were followed by NMR, MS and TIMS methods.},
